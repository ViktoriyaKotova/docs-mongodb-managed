This documentation describes the MongoDB Enterprise Service for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). The MongoDB Enterprise Service for PCF tile registers a service broker on PCF and exposes its service plans on the Marketplace.  Those plans are integrated with MongoDB Ops Manager.  Developers can provision MongoDB databases by creating instances of the service plans using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).

The MongoDB Enterprise Service for PCF has the following key features:

* The ability to provision a MongoDB service instance in standalone, replica set, or sharded cluster configuration
