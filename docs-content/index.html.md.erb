This documentation describes the MongoDB Managed Service for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). The MongoDB Managed Service for PCF tile registers a service broker on PCF and exposes its service plans on the Marketplace. Developers can provision MongoDB databases on an external MongoDB server by creating instances of the service plans using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).
